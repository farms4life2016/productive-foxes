# Productive Foxes

A farm-all-resources mod similar to Mystical Agriculture and Productive Bees, 
but instead of farm plants or bees, you farm resources
with berry bushes and cute foxes!

## Features
+ **Easy fox-wrangling!** We know how hard it is to move villagers, let alone foxes.
Now you can *shift-right click a **baby fox** with an open hand* to put the fox
on your shoulder! These shoulder-mounted foxes work the same way as shoulder-mounted parrots, 
meaning that they will dismount when you jump or fall into a liquid.
+ Other WIP features...
